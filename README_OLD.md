Anti-Attack AI
Anti-Attack AI is a privacy-first cybersecurity system designed to detect, isolate, and respond to cyberattacks in real time without accessing or storing sensitive company data.
What Problem Does It Solve?
Companies around the world lose billions every year due to cyberattacks.

Detects abnormal activities and attack patterns
Instantly isolates suspicious processes or connections
Sends fast alerts with the ability to rollback if it was a false alarm
