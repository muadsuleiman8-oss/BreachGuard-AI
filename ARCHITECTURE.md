System Architecture – Anti-Attack AI
Core Concept
Anti-Attack AI protects systems by analyzing behavior instead of accessing sensitive data.
It focuses on detecting abnormal patterns, not reading files or private information.
Monitoring Layer
The system monitors:
CPU and memory usage patterns
Network activity and connection behavior
Process execution behavior
Sudden or unusual system changes
No files or private data are inspected.
Detection Layer
AI models learn the normal behavior of the system. Any significant deviation triggers a risk signal.
Response Layer
When a potential attack is detected:
Suspicious processes are isolated
Network connections can be temporarily blocked
Affected components are sandboxed
No data is deleted automatically.
Alert & Recovery
Instant alerts are sent to administrators
Rollback option is available in case of false positives
Privacy by Design
No access to financial or personal data
No data storage outside the protected system
Local analysis only
Scalability
Designed to work with:
Small businesses
Medium enterprises
Large organizations
