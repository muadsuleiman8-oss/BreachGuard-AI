# AI Anti-Attack Intelligence

## Overview
AI Anti-Attack Intelligence is a security monitoring and response system designed to protect critical servers and enterprise infrastructure from cyber attacks in real time.

The system focuses on:
- Fast threat detection
- Immediate isolation of compromised servers
- Smart alerting without exposing private data
- Damage estimation and recovery support

This project is designed for companies, not individuals, and prioritizes reliability, speed, and trust.

## Core Features
- Real-time attack detection using intelligent rules
- Automatic server isolation with rollback capability
- Instant alerts via secure channels
- Minimal data exposure and privacy-first design
- Log analysis and attack behavior tracking
- Damage scope identification to reduce losses

## Architecture
- Server-side monitoring agent
- Central intelligence analyzer
- Alert and response engine
- Recovery and rollback controller

## Security Principles
- Zero Trust approach
- No customer data exfiltration
- Encrypted internal communication
- Fail-safe isolation mechanisms

## Current Status
Project initialized.
Core structure under active development.

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Monitoring & alert system
- Phase 2: Automated isolation engine
- Phase 3: AI-assisted threat analysis
- Phase 4: Enterprise dashboard
